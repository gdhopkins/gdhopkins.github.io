				This is the Javascripts page of the website I'll be using during my time in CSC106, <br>
				and will be adding to it over the next couple of months. The buttons above <br>
				will take you to the home page, this gallery of projects, the apps <br>
				that I made, and a page that will tell you more about me, Garrett. Enjoy!
