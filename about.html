				Welcome to the About Me page! Here you get to learn more about me, Garrett,<br>
                and what I'm like as a person. To begin with, I'm very introverted and tend to <br>
                stick to myself. Programming is something that I never really got into as a kid, <br>
                but as an adult it feels much more intuitive to me. I'm a Physics major, but I am <br>
                taking CSC106 as part of my major credits, and am always willing to help, <br>
                (almost) no matter what the issue is.
