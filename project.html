			This project, produced by myself and Tyreese, is a dots and boxes game. <br>
			For those unfamiliar, Dots and Boxes is a game where players take turns <br>
			drawing lines between dots in a grid. Players score points by drawing the <br>
			final side of any box, and the winner is the player with the most points. <br>
			<br> <!--Maybe empty line?-->
			In this Javascript receration of the game, there are options for a <br>
			resizable board and a reset button to easily play multiple rounds <br>
			with the same dimensions. It's a simple point and click program, <br>
			no keyboard neccessary!
